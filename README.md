This is another app I created while learning Flutter application development. I built this app by following a Udemy tutorial created by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller and added a few of my own features that I needed to build a real app. While building this app, I learned the following features and techniques in Flutter:
* usage of Enum in Fluter
* Efficiently Rendering Long Lists with ListView
* Nested Lists
* Icons & Formatting Dates
* Setting an AppBar with a Title & Actions
* Modal Sheet - Closing manually, open on an event, pass data from modal to parent widget, fullscreen Modal
* User Input on every keystroke
* Date Picker
* Showing & Managing "Snackbars"
* Setting up themes
* Responsive UI
* Safe Areas
* Login with Facebook
* login with Google
* Mutating Values in Memory & Making Sense of var, final & const
* Three Trees: Widget Tree, Element Tree & Render Tree
